# How to Organize your Project

how to organize the project.

## Repository Organization

Each Hackabilty Project **must be** well documented and organized in order to be considered concluded. There is no a general rule on how to document a project. What you must to is enable an user with good knowledge 
to replicate and improbe your project without much effort. Ence, you must organize and document the 
project in a propre way!
Except for the `README.md` file, **that is mandatory**, here you can find an guide line on how to organize 
your GitHun Project repo. 

### The Repository should be organized as following

    2. Name and date of the Hackability (e.g., Hackability@Polito, 2015)
    3. Detailed description of the project, with impages and information about the state of development of the project
    4. Credits, e.g., Team name and components, image of the team, acknowledgments, external links where the project have been published etc.
    5. License.

# Hackability Barilla 2017 - Artu

Artù is a robotic exoskeleton designed for quadriplegic people that have limited movements in general and, therefore, many difficulties in the kitchen while cooking or eating. Artu helps these patients to hold and to use objects for cutting (all the knives) and hot cups, kettles and similar containers.

## Artù - Why / When / Where

Artu was born around the needs of Pietro, our friend who lost the use of arms due to an accident.

The whole team created Artù during [Hackability@Barilla](http://www.hackability.it/hackabilitybarilla/). The devolpment took about one month, from January 20, 2018 to Februry 23, 2018.

The original idea was conceived at the Barilla Headquarters, Parma; the actual design, development and testing was carried out in Mantova (LTO Mantova) and Milano (Opendot).

## Artù - What

lightweight exoskeleton molded specifically to the shape of Pietro's forearm.

# Artu
## Hackability Barilla 2017

## What
Artù is a robotic exoskeleton designed for quadriplegic people that have limited movements in general and, therefore, many difficulties in the kitchen while cooking or eating. Artu helps these patients to hold and to use objects for cutting (all the knives) and hot cups, kettles and similar containers.

## Why / When / Where

Artu was born around the needs of Pietro, our friend who lost the use of arms due to an accident.

The whole team created Artù during [Hackability@Barilla](http://www.hackability.it/hackabilitybarilla/). The devolpment took about one month, from January 20, 2018 to Februry 23, 2018.

The original idea was conceived at the Barilla Headquarters, Parma; the actual design, development and testing was carried out in Mantova (LTO Mantova) and Milano (Opendot).

## How

### The exoskeleton

Artu has a lightweight exoskeleton molded specifically to the shape of Pietro's forearm.
The first prototype was made with a modeling paste and foam core. A second prototype was made of polyethylene, again molded specifically to the shape of Pietro's forearm.
Then, we designed a flattened version of exoskeleton in CAD and we made it lightweight using a honeycomb-like structure. The exoskeleton can be easily and quickly printed in 3D and hot bended around the arm.

### The motorized plier

...


### The assembled tool

As you see below, the plier is connected to the motor, which moves pull a steel thread, thus moving and locking  thighten the the movable finger. The motor is connected to the external box (bottom right in the photo), which containts the USB-rechargable power bank and two buttons on the top of the box for moving backward or forward the motor head.
